Custom NixOS packages for personal use. They're maintained on a best-effort basis and checked by CI on each push.

Included packages:

- [adb-sync] : Fork of [Google's adb-sync] with bugfixes for busybox users and the pull times feature
- [adx] : Rust tool to poll Google Maven for AndroidX packages and their latest versions
- [jetbrains-mono-nerdfonts] : Packaging of the [nerd-fonts] variant of [JetBrains' JetBrains Mono] typeface
- [lychee] : Packaging of [lychee], may be slightly out of date as I don't use it actively
- [pidcat] : Fork of [JakeWharton's pidcat] with Python3 support and some other fixes
